<p>Life can go from routine to crisis in an instant. Emergencies don't necessarily have to be life threatening but they can be. Those that occur at home are usually handled within the household or by calling professional responders.
  
</p>
    <p>We focus on those emergencies that can arise during travel or recreation.  Many folks buy survival kits or other items to help them handle these situations but do they really know what to do and how to use the stuff they have?
</p>
    <p>We can provide information, training, services and products to prepare you for these emergencies.  We know what works, what doesn't and why.

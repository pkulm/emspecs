      <p>Emergency preparedness generally refers to individuals and families evaluating risks to which they might be exposed and preparing accordingly.  Sometimes this includes churches, neighborhoods and small communities.  It may include training, stocking up on supplies, developing an organizational structure, emergency communications and others.  Or it may be just an individual who wants to be better prepared when engaging in a favorite activity.</p>
      <p>The three categories discussed on the home page have many elements.  Each one of these categories includes some popular topics.</p>

<h2>Major Events</h2>
      <p>While there are many scenarios and multiple variations within those scenarios, there are three common actions that people take:</p>
                    
    <p><strong>Shelter in place:</strong> This usually means staying at home and using whatever resources are available to meet the daily needs of the household members to include shelter, rest, food, water, medical care and security.  Most people are not prepared for more than a few days at best before they must have outside help.  If that help is not forthcoming things quickly become critical.</p>
    
      <h2><img src="Images/shelter.jpg" width="400" height="394" alt="Shelter in Place"></h2>
      <p><strong>Abandon ship:</strong> Load up what you have in the family car and get out of town, if you can.  Very few average citizens have a plan, the resources or the know-how to do this effectively.  An exception may be some folks who live in coastal areas subject to hurricanes.  Even there, even if they have been through a hurricane before, many are still not prepared.  This takes pre-planning, resources and training to pull off successfully.</p>
       <p><strong>Grouping together:</strong> If the situation is such that a community is not completely wiped out or otherwise made uninhabitable, residents may be able to pool their talents and resources to ride out the emergency.  This is much more difficult in today's society where many folks do not know their next door neighbor.</p>
        <p>A <strong>community plan</strong> can be very effective but it takes effort, resources and cooperation.  Rural communities are much more suitable for this type of plan than most urban areas.</p>

Public Safety</h1>
             <p>Natural and man-made emergencies and disasters can occur without warning and can tax the resources of even the best prepared organization, agency or jurisdiction.  A professional emergency management specialist can assess an needs, highlight vulnerabilities, and recommend comprehensive strategies to prepare for an effective response to a variety of emergencies.</p>

             <h1><a name="ST"></a>International Travel and Global Survival</h1>
             <p>Survival is often thought of as being stranded in some remote location and living off of the land until rescued. Much of what is taught as survival is based on popular myths and misconceptions.</p>
             <p><img src="Images/ST01.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="Survival Training" align="right" class="title-h1 scale-with-grid"></p>

             <p>The current popularity of "survivor" shows on television has only contributed to the confusion. Knowing how to plan and how to select and use the right equipment combined with state-of-the-art training can make the difference between life and death in a survival emergency.</p>
             
             <h2>Survival situations may result from:</h2>
             <ul class="circle">
               <li>Becoming lost</li>
               <li>An airplane crash</li>

    <h1><a name="SnR"></a>Search and Rescue</h1>
      
                    <p>Every day around the world people go missing for a wide variety of reasons. Some are just lost, some are accident victims, some are victims of a crime, and some may not even be aware they are lost, such as children and those who suffer from dementia.
</p>
                    <p><img src="Images/SnR01.jpg" width="370" height="250" alt="Search and Rescue" class="scale-with-grid"></p>
                    <p>A rapid response, with the right resources, and doing the right things in the right order can be life saving. Lack of planning, training, and experience can cost lives.</p>
      <p>We can prepare a complete search and rescue plan for your team or your jurisdiction that addresses all of these vital issues. In addition, we can tailor a training program to meet your specific needs.</p>
